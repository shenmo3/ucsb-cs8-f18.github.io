bio: >
Hi guys, my name is Alex Liu and I am a second year CS major student. I took CS24 last year with professor Mirza and she is a great professor. This quarter I am taking CS 130A data structure and CS 176A networking, if you are interested at those courses please feel free to ask me about them! If you want any advice of how to practice programming or how to success in this course, you can always ask me! My personal short advice is practice more, kind of like math. Also this quarter I will be leading a python project called 2D world Builder at IEEE, which is a simple and fun python game built for new CS students. You can find more info on that at IEEE facebook group. I did many projects in my freshman year, so don’t be afraid. These projects, even if you did not finish them, is a great way to learn new things. Never use the excuse “I am not ready,” there are so many things to learn and nobody is ever ready for everything, not even professors, so step outside of your comfort zone, do more and be successful!
